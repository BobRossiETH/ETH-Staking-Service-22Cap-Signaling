# Summary
This page tracks staking entities who have committed to cap their scope of control to under 22% of the Ethereum network's validators. The goal is to catalog staking entity responses and turn it into a resource that can be referenced by the Ethereum community. This catalog has been inspired by calls to action by the Ethereum community, particularly from recent [tweets](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1525218193756807169) and [Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/unt9m0/comment/i8d1bw9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by [@superphiz](https://twitter.com/superphiz) 

# The network only needs 66% participation to finalize, why is 22% important?
22% control is the threshold where 4 staking entities could collude to attack the Ethereum network. At the same time, 22% control is still viable as any one entity could go down without threatening finality of the chian. 

One threshold percentage had to be choosen to simplify this catalog's scope and prevent varied (and unfair) thresholds across staking entities. 22% is becoming a popular threshold in the community as it represents a middleground between the entirely new set of dangers >33% control brings while still not going too low to discourage staking entity committment all together.
