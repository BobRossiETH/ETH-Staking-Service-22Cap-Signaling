# Summary
This page tracks staking entities who have committed to cap their scope of control to under 22% of the Ethereum network's validators. The goal is to catalog staking entity responses and turn it into a resource that can be referenced by the Ethereum community. This catalog has been inspired by calls to action by the Ethereum community, particularly from recent [tweets](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1525218193756807169) and [Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/unt9m0/comment/i8d1bw9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by [@superphiz](https://twitter.com/superphiz) 

# The network only needs 66% participation to finalize, why is 22% important?
If each entity is limited to 22% of the validators on the beacon chain, it takes more than three entities in collusion to finalize the chain with inaccurate data. At the same time, 22% control is still viable as any one entity could go down without threatening finality of the chain.

One threshold percentage had to be chosen to simplify this catalog's scope and prevent varied (and unfair) thresholds across staking entities. 22% is becoming a popular threshold in the community as it represents a middle ground between the entirely new set of dangers >33% control brings while still not going too low to discourage staking entity committment all together. 

# What happens at 33%?

If any entity controls 33% of the network they can disrupt the network by preventing finalization since 66% of validators need to agree on the chain for finalization. It's easy to assume that this would be a malicious attack, but there are plenty of scenarios where a well-meaning entity with 33% could be forced to go offline against their will - consider somethign like a ransomeware attack that cripples one entity for a prolonged period.
