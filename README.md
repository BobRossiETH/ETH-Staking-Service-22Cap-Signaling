# Summary
This page tracks staking entities who have committed to cap their scope of control to under 22% of the Ethereum network's validators. The goal is to catalog staking entity responses and turn it into a resource that can be referenced for future Ethereum projects. This catalog has been inspired by calls to action by the Ethereum community, particularly from recent [tweets](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1525218193756807169) and [Reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/unt9m0/comment/i8d1bw9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by [@superphiz](https://twitter.com/superphiz) 

# The network only needs 66% participation to finalize, why is 22% important?
22% control is the threshold where 4 staking entities could collude to attack the Ethereum network. At the same time, any one provider with 22% control over the network can go down without threatening finality. The more decentralized the better, but to maintain a narrow scope the 22% threshold was chosen as the reasonable middleground between all possible thresholds.
